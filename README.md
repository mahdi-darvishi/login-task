It showcases a modern, clean, and scalable login flow using **Email or Phone Number with OTP verification**, with a strong focus on user experience, accessibility, and maintainable code.

The goal of this task is to demonstrate frontend skills, architectural decisions, and attention to detail rather than backend implementation.
